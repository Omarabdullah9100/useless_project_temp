# Ammini Browser

## Basic Details
### Team Name: CodeFather

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Pawan Murali - SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
- Member 2: Omar Abdullah K A - SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY  

### Project Description
A delightfully confusing web browser that embodies a loving grandmother who finds everything you're not looking for.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Modern browsers are too efficient and show users what they search for, depriving them of the authentic experience of asking their grandmother for help with technology.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created Ammini Browser - a browser that deliberately misunderstands your searches and responds just like a real grandmother would!
