# Ammini Browser üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: CodeFather

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Pawan Murali - SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
- Member 2: Omar Abdullah K A - SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY  

### Project Description
A delightfully confusing web browser that embodies a loving Malayalam grandmother who finds everything except what you're looking for, complete with fish curry recipes and neighborhood gossip.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Modern browsers are too efficient and actually show users what they search for, depriving them of the authentic experience of asking their grandmother for help with technology.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created Ammini Browser - a browser that deliberately misunderstands your searches and responds with fish curry recipes, Malayalam movie recommendations, and traditional remedies, just like a real grandmother would!
